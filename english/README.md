# PyLadies Workshops / PyCon PL

Welcome to PyLadies workshops! During this course, you will learn how to program in **Python** from scratch. To get started, you don't need to install anything, no prior knowledge of programming or computer science is required. All you need is an internet browser and a desire to acquire knowledge!

## What do these workshops teach?

This course will teach you how to create your own programs in Python. You will learn the basics of this language and find out how to expand your knowledge in the future, in order to independently create more interesting things. Thanks to these workshops, you will understand Python at a level that will allow you to write useful tools and delve into more advanced aspects of this language.

In summary: Your adventure with programming begins right here!

## Legend

Before we begin, familiarize yourself with the markings that have been used on the following pages of the course.

:snake: stands for a place where we give you a task to complete. If the instructions are unclear or the task is causing you trouble - ask for help from a mentor.

:pushpin: is a summary of the chapter. Before you continue, make sure you understand all the topics listed there. If you have any doubts - ask your mentor. Do not rely on others - that's why we do a summary, to make sure that everyone understood the chapter.

:checkered_flag: is the end of the chapter. Click on the link to proceed to the next one.

We highlighted important words and phrases with **bold text**. It is worth remembering them to better understand the following chapters.

`In this way`, we have marked the sample code of the programs.


## Mentors

Our team of mentors is here for you! If you have any questions, anything is unclear, or you are unsure how to complete a task - ask one of us for help. We are happy to answer, explain, and help you understand any topic. Don't hesitate: we also once asked questions and it is thanks to that that we can now answer them ourselves.
