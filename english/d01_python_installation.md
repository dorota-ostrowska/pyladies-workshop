# Appendix 1. Python Installation

Working on the repl.it website is convenient for learning, however, in order to fully utilize Python, it is worth installing it on your own computer. Below you will find instructions for installing Python on a Windows system. If you are using a different operating system, ask a mentor for help.

## Step 1: download the installation program.

Go to the website https://www.python.org/ and then open the "Downloads" tab and find the "Python 3.6.2" button. Click on it.
This way you will download the Python installation program.

## Step 2: run the installation program

Locate the installation program on your disk and run it. You will see a window titled "Install Python 3.7.0". Make sure that the option "Add Python 3.7 to PATH" is selected, then click the "Install Now" button.

## Step 3: Wait until the installation is complete

Python installation can take up to several minutes.

## Step 4: make sure that the installation process was successful.

If the installation is successful, the message "Setup was successful" will appear in the installation program window. If this does not happen, ask for help from a mentor.

## Step 5: Run the IDLE program.

Along with Python, the IDLE program was installed, where you can edit code files. There is also an interactive mode available. IDLE is a complete programming environment where you can create even advanced programs.

Find IDLE among the programs installed on your computer and run it.

## Step 6: interactive mode

After the first launch, the interactive mode will open by default. Try entering a few commands that you know.

## Step 7: Write and run your first program.

Click on the "File" option in the top bar of the window, then select "New File". An editor window will appear. Type in the code of a program, for example `print('PyLadies')`. Save the file by choosing "File" and then "Save". To run the program, click on "Run" and "Run Module" (or press the F5 key). The program will be executed. If it prints any text on the screen, you will see it in the interactive mode window.

That's all. You now have a programming environment for Python on your computer. You can write code for programs, save it in files, open and run them. You can also work in interactive mode.
