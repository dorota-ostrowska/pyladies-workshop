# Chapter 1. Interactive mode

We will start the workshop by explaining how we will be programming in Python.

## Let's begin!

Open [this link](https://repl.it/languages/python3) in a separate browser tab.

If you see a window asking you to create an account, close it by clicking 
on the "x".

The page you are viewing is divided into two parts: 

* on the left side, against a white background, is a text **editor**,
* on the right side, the **interactive mode** can be seen.

The editor allows you to create the entire code of the program, and 
then run it by pressing the "play" button (or using the key combination 
Ctrl + Enter). If the program outputs any text, we will see it in the 
interactive mode window.

The interactive mode works completely differently: it waits for a command 
to be entered, and when you press Enter, it executes it and displays its 
result. This way, you can program and immediately see the results.

Working with the interactive mode is convenient when you want to test the 
functionality of a single operation or when you are unsure which operations 
you want to perform. If you already know what program you want to write, then 
it is easier to use an editor.

There is one more important difference between interactive mode and an editor:
interactive mode always prints the result of an operation after it is executed. 
The editor will only do so if we give it such a command (using the `print` 
statement, which we will discuss later).

For now, we will be using the **interactive mode** as we will be learning 
individual instructions and observing their results. Do not be afraid to 
experiment with different variations of these commands. In the worst case scenario, 
Python will inform you that the entered code cannot be executed.

## Prompt sign

In the code examples that you will find in the following chapters, you will 
often see the character string `>>>`. This is the **prompt character**. 
We use it to distinguish text that should be entered in interactive mode 
from text that the Python interpreter prints out itself. If you see a prompt 
character in a line of an example, it means that everything that follows the 
character - until the end of the line - should be entered in interactive mode, 
and then the Enter key should be pressed. We do not enter the prompt character itself!

## :pushpin: Summary

In this chapter:

We opened the `repl.it` website, where we can program in either the **editor** or 
**interactive mode** of Python. We learned what the **prompt character** looks like 
and that it shows us the code to enter in interactive mode.

The next step is to analyze the data and identify patterns or trends. This will 
help us better understand the information and draw meaningful conclusions.

Once the data has been analyzed and patterns and trends have been identified, we 
can gain a deeper understanding of the information and draw significant conclusions.
